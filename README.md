# droplets_vs_bulk_survival_paper
 This code simulates the growth of beta-lactamase producing bacteria, inside droplets or in bulk and the associated survival rates.

There are 4 types of growth: binary - deterministic, Gillespie - stochastic simulation algorithm, becomes prohibitive as N is larger. Midpoint and adaptive Tau are two Tau-leaping algorithms, one proposed by Gillespie, one more advanced propose by Cao. They both map very similar to Gillespie, thus can be used to simulate large populations.
