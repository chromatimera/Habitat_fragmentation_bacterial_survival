@article{Zhou2006,
abstract = {This work is motivated by the recent experimental development of microfluidic flow-focusing devices that produce highly monodisperse simple or compound drops. Using finite elements with adaptive meshing in a diffuse-interface framework, we simulate the breakup of simple and compound jets in coflowing conditions, and explore the flow regimes that prevail in different parameter ranges. Moreover, we investigate the effects of viscoelasticity on interface rupture and drop pinch-off. The formation of simple drops exhibits a dripping regime at relatively low flow rates and a jetting regime at higher flow rates. In both regimes, drops form because of the combined effects of capillary instability and viscous drag. The drop size increases with the flow rate of the inner fluid and decreases with that of the outer fluid. Viscoelasticity in the drop phase increases the drop size in the dripping regime but decreases it in the jetting regime. The formation of compound drops is a delicate process that takes place in a n...},

abstract = {Antibiotic mode-of-action classification is based upon drug-target interaction and whether the resultant inhibition of cellular function is lethal to bacteria. Here we show that the three major classes of bactericidal antibiotics, regardless of drug-target interaction, stimulate the production of highly deleterious hydroxyl radicals in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, which ultimately contribute to cell death. We also show, in contrast, that bacteriostatic drugs do not produce hydroxyl radicals. We demonstrate that the mechanism of hydroxyl radical formation induced by bactericidal antibiotics is the end product of an oxidative damage cellular death pathway involving the tricarboxylic acid cycle, a transient depletion of NADH, destabilization of iron-sulfur clusters, and stimulation of the Fenton reaction. Our results suggest that all three major classes of bactericidal drugs can be potentiated by targeting bacterial systems that remediate hydroxyl radical damage, including proteins involved in triggering the DNA damage response, e.g., RecA.},

The biofilm begins to dispel the notion that bacteria are simply many single cells out for themselves in favor of the idea that they can act as groups of cooperating cells to enhance their individual fitness and increase the efficiency of the biofilm. This is not altruism per se, but rather by exploiting the biofilm, individual fitness is enhanced by the interactions. As with any mutualism or commensalism, this does not rule out selection on individual cells. This notion has transformed microbiology, and forces us to rethink the roles of microbes and how they operate within the earth's many ecosystems.},

Bacterial growth involves more than just a rate constant. To sustain exponential growth, the cell must carefully coordinate the accumulation of mass, constant replication of the chromosome, and physical division. Hence, the growth rate is centrally important in any physical and chemical description of a bacterial cell. These aspects of bacterial growth can be described by empirical laws that suggest simple and intuitive models. Therefore, a quantitative discussion of bacterial growth could be a part of any undergraduate biophysics course.

@article{Lyu2018,
abstract = {Antibiotic resistance has emerged as an imminent threat to public health. It is also increasingly recognized to be a heterogeneous phenomenon: a population of bacteria, found in vivo or in vitro, often consists of a mixture of cells that have different degrees of resistance to antibiotics. The conventional metric to measure antibiotic resistance based on an ensemble-average minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) fails to characterize the heterogeneity present within a bacterial population. This work describes a droplet microfluidics method to encapsulate single cells from a population consisting of a mixture of antibiotic-sensitive and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Co-encapsulating viability probe alamarBlue with the cells allows the use of fluorescent drops as a read-out for drops that contain live cells after their exposure to antibiotics. Enumerating the fluorescent drops thus gives the number of resistant cells in the population. Our method enables the quantitative phenotyping of heterogeneous resistance, or heteroresistance, with single-cell resolution. We show that it is possible to detect a resistant sub-population that comprises as low as 10−6 of the entire population of cells. Such high resolution further allows us to measure the evolution of heteroresistance arising from the exposure of a homogeneous isogenic culture of susceptible cells to sub-lethal dosages of antibiotics. We demonstrate an application of this system to characterize genetic determinants of antimicrobial resistance emergence. The high resolution of phenotypic detection and quantification of minority variants demonstrated in this work has the potential to facilitate the elucidation of the mechanisms underlying heteroresistance. Such understanding will in turn inform the best practices for antibiotic use and containment of antimicrobial resistance in a wide range of settings from agriculture and aquaculture to disease management. Clinically, the ability to quantify and track the composition of a bacterial population will benefit the decision-making process in both the diagnosis and the treatment of bacterial infections, and will ultimately improve patient outcome and avert the spread of resistant populations.},

abstract = {Bacterial growth environment strongly influences the efficacy of antibiotic treatment, with slow growth often being associated with decreased susceptibility. Yet in many cases, the connection between antibiotic susceptibility and pathogen physiology remains unclear. We show that for ribosome-targeting antibiotics acting on Escherichia coli, a complex interplay exists between physiology and antibiotic action; for some antibiotics within this class, faster growth indeed increases susceptibility, but for other antibiotics, the opposite is true. Remarkably, these observations can be explained by a simple mathematical model that combines drug transport and binding with physiological constraints. Our model reveals that growth-dependent susceptibility is controlled by a single parameter characterizing the ‘reversibility' of ribosome-targeting antibiotic transport and binding. This parameter provides a spectrum classification of antibiotic growth-dependent efficacy that appears to correspond at its extremes to existing binary classification schemes. In these limits, the model predicts universal, parameter-free limiting forms for growth inhibition curves. The model also leads to nontrivial predictions for the drug susceptibility of a translation mutant strain of E. coli, which we verify experimentally. Drug action and bacterial metabolism are mechanistically complex; nevertheless, this study illustrates how coarse-grained models can be used to integrate pathogen physiology into drug design and treatment strategies.},

Single cells are compartmentalized in emulsion droplets, which can be sorted using dielectrophoresis in a fluorescence-activated manner (as in FACS) at rates up to 2000 droplets s−1. To validate the system, mixtures of E. colicells, expressing either the reporter enzyme $\beta$-galactosidase or an inactive variant, were compartmentalized with a fluorogenic substrate and sorted at rates of ∼300 droplets s−1. The false positive error rate of the sorter at this throughput was {\textless}1 in 104 droplets. Analysis of the sorted cells revealed that the primary limit to enrichment was the co-encapsulation of E. colicells, not sorting errors: a theoretical model based on the Poisson distribution accurately predicted the observed enrichment values using the starting cell density (cells per droplet) and the ratio of active to inactive cells. When the cells were encapsulated at low density (∼1 cell for every 50 droplets), sorting was very efficient and all of the recovered cells were the active strain. In addition, single active droplets were sorted and cells were successfully recovered.},

abstract = {The explosive growth in our knowledge of genomes, proteomes, and metabolomes is driving ever-increasing fundamental understanding of the biochemistry of life, enabling qualitatively new studies of complex biological systems and their evolution. This knowledge also drives modern biotechnologies, such as molecular engineering and synthetic biology, which have enormous potential to address urgent problems, including developing potent new drugs and providing environmentally friendly energy. Many of these studies, however, are ultimately limited by their need for even-higher-throughput measurements of biochemical reactions. We present a general ultrahigh-throughput screening platform using drop-based microfluidics that overcomes these limitations and revolutionizes both the scale and speed of screening. We use aqueous drops dispersed in oil as picoliter-volume reaction vessels and screen them at rates of thousands per second. To demonstrate its power, we apply the system to directed evolution, identifying new mutants of the enzyme horseradish peroxidase exhibiting catalytic rates more than 10 times faster than their parent, which is already a very efficient enzyme. We exploit the ultrahigh throughput to use an initial purifying selection that removes inactive mutants; we identify approximately 100 variants comparable in activity to the parent from an initial population of approximately 10(7). After a second generation of mutagenesis and high-stringency screening, we identify several significantly improved mutants, some approaching diffusion-limited efficiency. In total, we screen approximately 10(8) individual enzyme reactions in only 10 h, using {\textless} 150 microL of total reagent volume; compared to state-of-the-art robotic screening systems, we perform the entire assay with a 1,000-fold increase in speed and a 1-million-fold reduction in cost.},

abstract = {A droplet-based microfluidic reaction scheme is developed where the chemical reactants are dispensed with precise volume control into pairs of droplets. The reaction is activated by coalescing droplet pairs and fast mixing inside the coalesced droplets. Furthermore, the pre-processing of the chemical products is included in the microfluidic device. This reaction scheme allows the performing of precisely volume controlled reactions and long operation times without any clogging even if precipitates or sticky gels are formed during the reaction. Using this approach and optimizing the reaction parameters, we generate mesoporous silica microspheres from a rapid gelation optimized sol–gel synthesis route. The produced silica particles have a superior surface area of 820 m2 g−1 and a narrow pore radius distribution of around 2.4 nm.},

abstract = {A microfluidic and optical system was created for the detection and analysis of single molecules in solution. Fluidic channels with submicrometer dimensions were used to isolate, detect and identify individual quantum dots conjugated with organic fluorophores. The channels were fabricated in fused silica with a 500 nm square cross section. The resulting focal volume of approximately 500 aL reduced fluorescent background and increased the signal to noise ratio of single molecule detection. The channels also enabled the rapid detection of 99{\%} of quantum dots and organic fluorophores traversing the focal volume. Conjugates were driven through the channels electrokinetically at 2.3 kV cm−1, excited with a single 476 nm wavelength laser and detected with a confocal microscope. Fluorescence emission was collected simultaneously from green (500–590 nm) and red (610–680 nm) regions of the spectrum. Signal rejection was minimized by the narrow and symmetric emission spectra of the quantum dots. To demonstrate efficient multicolor detection and characterization of single molecule binding, Qdot 655 Streptavidin Conjugates were bound to Alexa Fluor 488 molecules and individually detected. Photon counting histogram analysis was used to quantify coincident detection and degree of binding. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy was used to measure the mobility of bound and unbound species. The union of fluidic channels with submicrometer dimensions and quantum dots as fluorescent labels resulted in efficient and rapid multiplexed single molecule detection and analysis.},

Although the primary currency of neural information processing is electrical, many of the downstream effects of the electrical signals on the circuits that generate them are dependent on activity-dependent increases in intracellular calcium concentration. It is therefore of great utility to be able to record electrical signals in neural circuits at multiple sites, while at the same time detecting optical signals from reporters of intracellular calcium levels. We describe here a microfluidic multi-electrode array (MMEA) capable of high-resolution extracellular recording from brain slices that is optically compatible with calcium imaging at single cell resolution. We show the application of the MMEA device to record waves of spontaneous activity in developing cortical slices and to perform multi-site extracellular recordings during simultaneous calcium imaging of activity. The MMEA has the unique capability to simultaneously allow focal electrical and chemical stimuli at different locations of the surface of a brain slice.},

abstract = {Important insights into aging have been generated with the genetically tractable and short-lived budding yeast. However, it is still impossible today to continuously track cells by high-resolution microscopic imaging (e.g., fluorescent imaging) throughout their entire lifespan. Instead, the field still needs to rely on a 50-y-old laborious and time-consuming method to assess the lifespan of yeast cells and to isolate differentially aged cells for microscopic snapshots via manual dissection of daughter cells from the larger mother cell. Here, we are unique in achieving continuous and high-resolution microscopic imaging of the entire replicative lifespan of single yeast cells. Our microfluidic dissection platform features an optically prealigned single focal plane and an integrated array of soft elastomer-based micropads, used together to allow for trapping of mother cells, removal of daughter cells, monitoring gradual changes in aging, and unprecedented microscopic imaging of the whole aging process. Using the platform, we found remarkable age-associated changes in phenotypes (e.g., that cells can show strikingly differential cell and vacuole morphologies at the moment of their deaths), indicating substantial heterogeneity in cell aging and death. We envision the microfluidic dissection platform to become a major tool in aging research.},

abstract = {The quantitative study of the cell growth [1–5] has led to many fundamental insights in our understanding of a wide range of subjects, from the cell cycle [6–9] to senescence [10]. Of particular importance is the growth rate, whose constancy represents a physiological steady state of an organism. Recent studies, however, suggest that the rate of elongation during exponential growth of bacterial cells decreases cumulatively with replicative age for both asymmetrically [11] and symmetrically [12, 13] dividing organisms, implying that a “steady-state” population consists of individual cells that are never in a steady state of growth. To resolve this seeming paradoxical observation, we studied the long-term growth and division patterns of Escherichia coli cells by employing a microfluidic device designed to follow steady-state growth and division of a large number of cells at a defined reproductive age. Our analysis of approximately 105 individual cells reveals a remarkable stability of growth whereby the mother cell inherits the same pole for hundreds of generations. We further show that death of E. coli is not purely stochastic but is the result of accumulating damages. We conclude that E. coli, unlike all other aging model systems studied to date, has a robust mechanism of growth that is decoupled from cell death.},

abstract = {Microfluidic water-in-oil droplets that serve as separate, chemically isolated compartments can be applied for single-cell analysis; however, to investigate encapsulated cells effectively over prolonged time periods, an array of droplets must remain stationary on a versatile substrate for optimal cell compatibility. We present here a platform of unique geometry and substrate versatility that generates a stationary nanodroplet array by using wells branching off a main microfluidic channel. These droplets are confined by multiple sides of a nanowell and are in direct contact with a biocompatible substrate of choice. The device is operated by a unique and reversed loading procedure that eliminates the need for fine pressure control or external tubing. Fluorocarbon oil isolates the droplets and provides soluble oxygen for the cells. By using this approach, the metabolic activity of single adherent cells was monitored continuously over time, and the concentration of viable pathogens in blood-derived samples was determined directly by measuring the number of colony-formed droplets. The method is simple to operate, requires a few microliters of reagent volume, is portable, is reusable, and allows for cell retrieval. This technology may be particularly useful for multiplexed assays for which prolonged and simultaneous visual inspection of many isolated single adherent or nonadherent cells is required.},

The same time period of 6 h incubation at 366 mOsmol kg-1 was required to obtain a high growth rate of AFP-27 cells at 440 mOsmol kg-1 when the cells were subjected to a two-step increase of osmotic pressure from 300 mOsmol kg-1 to 366 mOsmol kg-1 and then to 440 mOsmol kg-1. The time length for the physiological adaptation of the cells to 366 mOsmol kg-1 was consequently estimated to be 6 h. Osmotic pressure during batch cultivation was gradually increased from 300 mOsmol kg-1 to 400 mOsmol kg-1 with an adaptation time of at least 6 h. The specific growth rates following a gradual increase of osmotic pressure were higher than those at a constant osmotic pressure of 400 mOsmol kg-1, while the specific monoclonal antibody production rate increased with the increase in the mean osmotic pressure. As a result, the cells grown under a gradual increase of osmotic pressure produced higher amounts of monoclonal antibodies than did those grown under constant osmotic pressure.},

This paper characterizes this problem as it applies to microfluidic cell culture in poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) devices and provides a practical solution. Evaporation-mediated osmolality shifts through PDMS membranes with varying thicknesses (10, 1, 0.2, or 0.1 mm) were measured over 96 h. Even in humidified cell culture incubators, evaporation through PDMS and associated shifts in the osmolality of culture media was significant and prevented mouse embryo and human endothelial cell growth and development. A simple diffusion model, where the measured diffusion coefficient for PDMS matches reported values of ∼10-9 m2/s, accounts for these evaporation and osmolality shifts. To overcome this problem, a PDMS−parylene−PDMS hybrid membrane was developed that greatly suppresses evaporation and osmolality shifts, yet possesses thinness and the flexibility necessary to interface with deformation-based microfluidic actuation systems, ...},

This paper describes the control of protein adsorption at the liquid−liquid interface in a plug-based microfluidic system. The microfluidic system uses multiphase flows of immiscible fluorous and aqueous fluids to form plugs, which are aqueous droplets that are completely surrounded by fluorocarbon oil and do not come into direct contact with the hydrophobic surface of the microchannel. Protein adsorption at the aqueous−fluorous interface was controlled by using surfactants that were soluble in fluorocarbon oil but insoluble in aqueous solutions. Three perfluorinated alkane surfactants capped with different functional groups were used:  a carboxylic acid, an alcohol, and a triethylene glycol group that was synthesized from commercially available materials.

We considered three aspects of compatibility:  the swelling of PDMS in a solvent, the partitioning of solutes between a solvent and PDMS, and the dissolution of PDMS oligomers in a solvent. Of these three parameters that determine the compatibility of PDMS with a solvent, the swelling of PDMS had the greatest influence. Experimental measurements of swelling were correlated with the solubility parameter, $\delta$ (cal1/2 cm-3/2), which is based on the cohesive energy densities, c (cal/cm3), of the materials.

abstract = {We present a new family of microfluidic chips hot embossed from a commercial fluorinated thermoplastic polymer (Dyneon THV). This material shares most of the properties of fluoro polymers (very low surface energy and resistance to chemicals), but is easier to process due to its relatively low melting point. Finally, as an elastic material it also allows easy world to chip connections. Fluoropolymer films can be imprinted by hot embossing from PDMS molds prepared by soft lithography. Chips are then sealed by an original technique (termed Monolithic-Adhesive-Bonding), using two different grades of fluoropolymer to obtain uniform mechanical, chemical and surface properties. This fabrication process is well adapted to rapid prototyping, but it also has potential for low cost industrial production, since it does not require any curing or etching step. We prepared microfluidic devices with micrometre resolution features, that are optically transparent, and that provide good resistance to pressure (up to 50 kPa). We demonstrated the transport of water droplets in fluorinated oil, and fluorescence detection of DNA within the droplets. No measurable interaction of the droplets with the channels wall was observed, alleviating the need for surface treatment previously necessary for droplet applications in microfluidic chips. These chips can also handle harsh organic solvents. For instance, we demonstrated the formation of chloroform droplets in fluorinated oil, expanding the potential for on chip microchemistry.},

abstract = {We present transient measurements of the flow field during the formation of bubbles in a microfluidic T-junction. Using microscopic particle image velocimetry ($\mu$-PIV), velocities in a 800$\mu$m squared T-junction were measured with a spatial resolution of 20×20×100$\mu$m3. Three-dimensional velocity distributions in the continuous phase were constructed from planar velocity fields measured at four different depths. The image acquisition frequency was phase-locked to the bubble frequency by triggering the system on the passing of a bubble. This allowed for the measurement of the velocities at different instances in the periodic formation cycle with a high temporal resolution (∼5ms). The shape and movement of the interface between the two immiscible phases were measured by means of a high speed camera. It was observed that at no instance, the growing bubble fully blocks the channel. At least 25{\%} of the insurgent liquid creeps through the menisci in the corners of the channel. The quantification of this leakage allows the prediction of bubble volume and the amount of liquid separating the bubbles without fitted parameters. Prior to break-up, the rapid constriction of the bubble neck starts when the neck radius equals one-fourth of the channel width. This coincides with flow reversal around the bubble, which can be explained from the Laplace pressure terms.},

In this regime, the breakup process is driven chiefly by the buildup of pressure upstream of an emerging droplet and both the dynamics of breakup and the scaling of the sizes of droplets are influenced only very weakly by the value of the capillary number. The dripping regime, while apparently homologous to the unbounded case, is also significantly influenced by the constrained geometry; these effects modify the scaling law for the size of the droplets derived from the balance of interfacial and viscous stresses. Finally, the jetting regime sets in only at very high flow rates, or with low interfacial tension, i.e. higher values of the capillary number, similar to the unbounded case.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater}},

Then three practical aspects are studied in detail: (i) The formation of drops and the dominant interactions depending on the geometry in which they are formed. (ii) The transport of drops, namely the evaluation of drop velocity, the pressure-velocity relationships, and the flow field induced by the presence of the drop.

Encapsulation uses a cell-triggered Rayleigh-Plateau instability in a flow-focusing geometry, and self-sorting puts to work two extra hydrodynamic mechanisms: lateral drift of deformable objects in a shear flow, and sterically driven dispersion in a compressional flow. Encapsulation and sorting are achieved on-flight in continuous flow at a rate up to 160 cells per second. The whole process is robust and cost-effective, involving no optical or electrical discrimination, active sorting, flow switching, or moving parts. Successful encapsulation and sorting of 70-80{\%} of the injected cell population into drops containing one and only one cell, with {\textless}1{\%} contamination by empty droplets, is demonstrated. The system is also applied to the direct encapsulation and sorting of cancerous lymphocytes from a whole blood mixture, yielding individually encapsulated cancer cells with a {\textgreater}10,000-fold enrichment as compared with the initial mix.

An efficiency of up to 77{\%} was reached, overcoming the limitations imposed by Poisson statistics for random cell loading, which yields only 37{\%} of drops containing a single cell. Furthermore, we confirm that {\textgreater} 90{\%} of the cells remain viable. The simple planar structure and high throughput provided by this passive microfluidic approach makes it attractive for implementation in lab on a chip (LOC) devices for single cell applications using droplet-based platforms.},

A method whereby a nucleic acid sequence can be exponentially amplified in vitro is described in the chapter. The same method can be used to alter the amplified sequence or to append new sequence information to it. It is necessary that the ends of the sequence be known in sufficient detail that oligonucleotides can be synthesized, which will hybridize to them and that a small amount of the sequence be available to initiate the reaction. The oligonucleotides are complementary to different strands of the desired sequence and at relative positions along the sequence such that the DNA polymerase extension product of the one, when denatured, can serve as a template for the other and vice versa. Oligonucleotides were synthesized using an automated DNA synthesis machine (Biosearch, Inc., San Rafael, California) using phosphoramidite chemistry. “Mispriming"” can be usefully employed to make intentional in vitro mutations or to add sequence information to one or both ends of a given sequence. The chapter explores the possibility of utilizing a heat-stable DNA polymerase so as to avoid the need for addition of new enzyme after each cycle of thermal denaturation},

Plugs are droplets transported through microchannels by fluorocarbon fluids. A plug-based microfluidic system was developed to titrate an anticoagulant (argatroban) into blood samples and to measure the clotting time using the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) test. To carry out these experiments, the following techniques were developed for a plug-based system: (i) using Teflon AF coating on the microchannel wall to enable formation of plugs containing blood and transport of the solid fibrin clots within plugs, (ii) using a hydrophilic glass capillary to enable reliable merging of a reagent from an aqueous stream into plugs, (iii) using bright-field microscopy to detect the formation of a fibrin clot within plugs and using fluorescent microscopy to detect the production of thrombin using a fluorogenic substrate, and (iv) titration of argatroban (0-1.5 microg/mL) into plugs and measurement of the resulting APTTs at room temperature (23 degrees C) and physiological temperature (37 degrees C). APTT measurements were conducted with normal pooled plasma (platelet-poor plasma) and with donor's blood samples (both whole blood and platelet-rich plasma). APTT values and APTT ratios measured by the plug-based microfluidic device were compared to the results from a clinical laboratory at 37 degrees C. APTT obtained from the on-chip assay were about double those from the clinical laboratory but the APTT ratios from these two methods agreed well with each other.},

We show that the droplet size can be quantitatively predicted from the flow profiles of the fluids. The double emulsions were used to generate encapsulation structures by manipulating the properties of the fluid that makes up the shell. The high degree of control afforded by this method and the completely separate fluid streams make this a flexible and promising technique.},

By controlling the surfactant bulk concentration of a soluble nonionic surfactant in the neighborhood of the critical micelle concentration, along with the capillary number and the ratio of the internal and external flow rates, we observe several distinct modes of droplet breakup. For the most part, droplet breakup in microfluidic devices results in highly monodisperse droplets in the range of tens of micrometers in size. However, we observe a new mode of breakup called “thread formation” that resembles tipstreaming and yields tiny droplets in the range of a few micrometers in size or smaller.

The recirculation motion in the liquid segments associated with gas–liquid flows as well as the symmetry characteristics of the recirculations are quantified for straight and meandering channel networks. Even minor surface roughness effects and the compressibility of the gas phase induce loss of symmetry and enhance mixing across the centerline in straight channels. Mixing is further accelerated in meandering channels by the periodic switching of recirculation patterns across the channel center. We demonstrate a new, piezoelectrically activated flow injection technique for determining residence time distributions (RTDs) of fluid elements in multiphase microfluidic systems. The results confirm a narrowed liquid phase RTD in segmented flows in comparison to their single-phase counterparts.

abstract = {A microfluidic device designed to generate monodispersed picoliter to femtoliter sized droplet emulsions at controlled rates is presented. This PDMS microfabricated device utilizes the geometry of the channel junctions in addition to the flow rates to control the droplet sizes. An expanding nozzle is used to control the breakup location of the droplet generation process. The droplet breakup occurs at a fixed point due to the focused velocity gradient created by the nozzle shape geometry. The system not only creates monodispersed primary droplets with sizes controlled by the applied flow rates, but also generates monodispersed submicron droplets. Droplets with radii as less than 100nm can be produced without use of surfactants. Numerical results relating flow rates to the size of primary droplets, satellite droplets and generation rates are reported.},

abstract = {We present a novel millifluidic droplet analyser (MDA) for precisely monitoring the dynamics of microbial populations over multiple generations in numerous (≥103) aqueous emulsion droplets (∼100 nL). As a first application, we measure the growth rate of a bacterial strain and determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the antibiotic cefotaxime by incubating bacteria in a fine gradient of antibiotic concentrations. The detection of cell activity is based on the automated detection of an epifluorescent signal that allows the monitoring of microbial populations up to a size of ∼106cells. We believe that this device is helpful for the study of population dynamic consequences of microbe-environment interactions and of individual cell differences. Moreover, the fluidic machine may improve clinical tests, as it simplifies, automates and miniaturizes the screening of numerous microbial populations that grow and evolve in compartments with a finely tuned composition.},

Unlike conventional approaches that require bulky pumps, control computers, and expertise with device physics to operate devices, our method requires only the microfluidic device and a hand-operated syringe. The fluids needed for the emulsion are loaded into the device inlets, while the syringe is used to create a vacuum at the device outlet; this sucks the fluids through the channels, generating the drops. By controlling the hydrodynamic resistances of the channels using hydrodynamic resistors and valves, we are able to control the properties of the drops. This provides a simple and highly portable method for creating monodisperse emulsions.},

abstract = {Microorganisms are widely used to generate valuable products, and their efficiency is a major industrial focus. Bioreactors are typically composed of billions of cells, and available measurements only reflect the overall performance of the population. However, cells do not equally contribute, and process optimization would therefore benefit from monitoring this intrapopulation diversity. Such monitoring has so far remained difficult because of the inability to probe concentration changes at the single-cell level. Here, we unlock this limitation by taking advantage of the osmotically driven water flux between a droplet containing a living cell toward surrounding empty droplets, within a concentrated inverse emulsion. With proper formulation, excreted products are far more soluble within the continuous hydrophobic phase compared to initial nutrients (carbohydrates and salts). Fast diffusion of products induces an osmotic mismatch, which further relaxes due to slower diffusion of water through hydrophobic interfaces. By measuring droplet volume variations, we can deduce the metabolic activity down to isolated single cells. As a proof of concept, we present the first direct measurement of the maintenance energy of individual yeast cells. This method does not require any added probes and can in principle apply to any osmotically sensitive bioactivity, opening new routes for screening, and sorting large libraries of microorganisms and biomolecules.},

Then three practical aspects are studied in detail: (i) The formation of drops and the dominant interactions depending on the geometry in which they are formed. (ii) The transport of drops, namely the evaluation of drop velocity, the pressure-velocity relationships, and the flow field induced by the presence of the drop.

abstract = {The crucial early stages of amyloid growth, in which normally soluble proteins are converted into fibrillar nanostructures, are challenging to study using conventional techniques yet are critical to the protein aggregation phenomena implicated in many common pathologies. As with all nucleation and growth phenomena, it is difficult to track individual nuclei in traditional macroscopic experiments, which probe the overall temporal evolution of the sample, but do not yield detailed information on the primary nucleation step as they mix independent stochastic events into an ensemble measurement. To overcome this limitation, we have developed microdroplet assays enabling us to detect single primary nucleation events and to monitor their subsequent spatial as well as temporal evolution, both of which we find to be determined by secondary nucleation phenomena. By deforming the droplets to high aspect ratio, we visualize in real-time propagating waves of protein assembly emanating from discrete primary nucleation sites. We show that, in contrast to classical gelation phenomena, the primary nucleation step is characterized by a striking dependence on system size, and the filamentous protein self-assembly process involves a highly nonuniform spatial distribution of aggregates. These findings deviate markedly from the current picture of amyloid growth and uncover a general driving force, originating from confinement, which, together with biological quality control mechanisms, helps proteins remain soluble and therefore functional in nature.},

However, relatively few studies investigate the binding kinetics on modified bead surfaces in a microfluidics context. In this study, a customized hot embossing technique is used to stamp microwells in a thin plastic substrate where streptavidin-coated agarose beads are selectively placed and subsequently immobilized within a conduit. Biotinylated quantum dots are used as a label to monitor target analyte binding to the bead's surface. Three-dimensional finite element simulations are carried out to model the binding kinetics on the bead's surface. The model accounts for surface exclusion effects resulting from a single quantum dot occluding multiple receptor sites. The theoretical predictions are compared and favorably agree with experimental observations. The theoretical simulations provide a useful tool to predict how varying parameters affect microbead reaction kinetics and sensor performance.

abstract = {Cover crop cultivation during the cold fallow season has been strongly recommended in mono-rice cultivation system to improve soil quality. Its addition as green manure could stimulate methane (CH4) emission in the submerged paddy soil during rice cultivation, but its effect has not been evaluated well. Leguminous Chinese milk vetch (hereafter milk vetch) and non-leguminous rye were seeded after rice harvesting in 2008 and 2009, and total above-ground biomasses were incorporated with the recommended mineral fertilizers (NPK+milk vetch, and NPK+rye, respectively) before rice transplanting in 2009 and 2010. No fertilization (control) and mineral fertilization alone (NPK) plots were installed for comparison. Methane flux which was investigated by the closed chamber method during rice cultivation was significantly increased by chemical fertilization to ca. 80-250{\%} over the control (138-141kgCH4ha-1), but increased more markedly by cover crop biomass addition to ca. 28-121{\%} over the NPK treatment. Milk vetch was more effective on stimulating less CH4emission (28-61{\%} increase over NPK) and improving rice productivity (18-31{\%} increase over NPK) than rye (86-121{\%} increase of CH4emission and -3-6{\%} of yield increase over NPK). As a result, the total CH4flux per grain yield was significantly increased by rye addition, but were similar between the NPK+milk vetch and NPK treatments. Conclusively, low C/N ratio cover crop like milk vetch might be more recommendable green manure to minimize CH4emission impact and increase rice productivity than high C/N ratio cover crop like rye in paddy soil. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

In this tutorial review, we introduce the concept of microfluidic stochastic confinement for use in detection and analysis of rare cells. Stochastic confinement provides two advantages: (1) it separates rare single cells from the bulk mixture and (2) it allows signals to locally accumulate to a higher concentration around a single cell than in the bulk mixture. Microfluidics is an attractive method for implementing stochastic confinement because it provides simple handling of small volumes. We present technologies for microfluidic stochastic confinement that utilize both wells and droplets for the detection and analysis of single cells. We address how these microfluidic technologies have been used to observe new behavior, increase speed of detection, and enhance cultivation of rare cells. We discuss potential applications of microfluidic stochastic confinement to fields such as human diagnostics and environmental testing.},

Compared with other microfluidic materials [e.g., poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)] the whole-Teflon chip has a few more advantages, such as no absorption of small molecules, little adsorption of biomolecules onto channel walls, and no leaching of residue molecules from the material bulk into the solution in the channel. Various biological cells have been cultured in the whole-Teflon channel. Adherent cells can attach to the channel bottom, spread, and proliferate well in the channels (with similar proliferation rate to the cells in PDMS channels with the same dimensions).

abstract = {In this thesis, I present three microscopic studies of surface growing Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) microcolonies. All experiments were carried out by growing microcolonies on agarose pads, and imaging their growth using phase contrast, uorescence and confocal microscopy. In the rst project, the importance of spatial structure and growth strategies between competing populations of E. coli was studied. An agarose pad was seeded with bacterial cells and their colonisation success tracked. Cell lag-times and local cell density were found to play important roles in determining the eventual success of a colony. Arrangements of neighbouring cells were found to be partially responsible at high cell densities. These results were reproduced using a simple simulation, which also highlighted the importance of exponential expansion in determining colonisation success. The second project investigates the e ect of con nement on growing microcolonies restricted to one plane (2d growth). Colonies were grown in agarose micro- channels with di erent aspect ratios, and in uncon ned environments. In particular internal physical colony structure and genealogical structure was studied by using single-cell tracking. Results showed that relatedness between cells was directionally biased (cells tended to be more closely related to cells at their poles, than to their side) regardless of the amount of spatial restriction. Furthermore, con nement caused cells to align with each other more, and induced high cell velocities at the colony edges driven by cell expansion. In the nal project, growth of secondary layers in growing colonies of E. coli was studied. Cells initially grew as a monolayer, before invading the agarose bulk, producing a secondary layer. By analysing time-lapse movies, this layer was found to initially expand rapidly well in excess of cell growth rates and initial colony expansion rates, before slowing down. The initial secondary growth rate likely depends on the colony area at agarose invasion. Furthermore, the colony area when colonies invaded the agarose depended on their rate of growth, suggesting a complex interplay between forces exerted by the agarose, and by the colony.},

abstract = {Bacteria display various shapes and rely on complex spatial organization of their intracellular components for many cellular processes. This organization changes in response to internal and external cues. Quantitative, unbiased study of these spatio-temporal dynamics requires automated image analysis of large microscopy datasets. We have therefore developed MicrobeTracker, a versatile and high-throughput image analysis program that outlines and segments cells with subpixel precision, even in crowded images and mini-colonies, enabling cell lineage tracking. MicrobeTracker comes with an integrated accessory tool, SpotFinder, which precisely tracks foci of fluorescently labelled molecules inside cells. Using MicrobeTracker, we discover that the dynamics of the extensively studied Escherichia coli Min oscillator depends on Min protein concentration, unveiling critical limitations in robustness within the oscillator. We also find that the fraction of MinD proteins oscillating increases with cell length, indicating that the oscillator has evolved to be most effective when cells attain an appropriate length. MicrobeTracker was also used to uncover novel aspects of morphogenesis and cell cycle regulation in Caulobacter crescentus. By tracking filamentous cells, we show that the chromosomal origin at the old-pole is responsible for most replication/separation events while the others remain largely silent despite contiguous cytoplasm. This surprising position-dependent silencing is regulated by division.},

abstract = {Today, rapid detection and identification of bacteria in microbiological diagnosis is a major issue. Reference methods usually rely on growth of microorganisms, with the drawback of lengthy time-to-result. The method provides global information on a clonal population that is known to be inhomogeneous relative to metabolic states and activities. Therefore, there may be a significant advantage of methods that allow characterisation of individual bacteria from a large population, both for test time reduction and the clinical value of the characterisation. We report here a method for rapid detection and real-time monitoring of the metabolic activities of single bacteria. Water-in-oil emulsions were used to encapsulate single Escherichia coli cells into picolitre (pL)-sized microreactor droplets. The glucuronidase activity in each droplet was monitored using the fluorogenic reporter molecule MUG (4-methylumbelliferyl-$\beta$- d-glucuronide) coupled to time-lapse fluorescence imaging of the droplets. Such bacterial confinement provides several major advantages.(1)Enzymatic activities of a large number of single bacterium-containing droplet could be monitored simultaneously, allowing the full characterisation of metabolic heterogeneity in a clonal population. We monitored glucuronidase enzymatic activity and growth over ∼200 single bacteria over a 24-h period.(2)Micro-confinement of cells in small volumes allows rapid accumulation of the fluorescent metabolite, hence decreasing the detection time. Independent of the initial concentration of bacteria in the sample, detection of the presence of bacteria could be achieved in less than 2h.(3)Considering the random distribution of bacteria in droplets, this method allowed rapid and reliable enumeration of bacteria in the initial sample.Overall, the results of this study showed that confinement of bacterial cells increased the effective concentration of fluorescent metabolites leading to rapid (2. h) detection of the fluorescent metabolites, thus significantly reducing time to numeration. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Microfabricated integrated circuits revolutionized computation by vastly reducing the space, labor, and time required for calculations. Microfluidic systems hold similar promise for the large-scale automation of chemistry and biology, suggesting the possibility of numerous experiments performed rapidly and in parallel, while consuming little reagent. While it is too early to tell whether such a vision will be realized, significant progress has been achieved, and various applications of significant scientific and practical interest have been developed. Here a review of the physics of small volumes (nanoliters) of fluids is presented, as parametrized by a series of dimensionless numbers expressing the relative importance of various physical phenomena. Specifically, this review explores the Reynolds number Re, addressing inertial effects; the Peclet number Pe, which concerns convective and diffusive transport; the capillary number Ca expressing the importance of interfacial tension; the Deborah, Weissenberg, and elasticity numbers De, Wi, and El, describing elastic effects due to deformable microstructural elements like polymers; the Grashof and Rayleigh numbers Gr and Ra, describing density-driven flows; and the Knudsen number, describing the importance of noncontinuum molecular effects. Furthermore, the long-range nature of viscous flows and the small device dimensions inherent in microfluidics mean that the influence of boundaries is typically significant. A variety of strategies have been developed to manipulate fluids by exploiting boundary effects; among these are electrokinetic effects, acoustic streaming, and fluid-structure interactions. The goal is to describe the physics behind the rich variety of fluid phenomena occurring on the nanoliter scale using simple scaling arguments, with the hopes of developing an intuitive sense for this occasionally counterintuitive world.},

abstract = {Excessive and indiscriminate use of antibiotics to treat bacterial infections has lead to the emergence of multiple drug resistant strains. Most infectious diseases are caused by bacteria which proliferate within quorum sensing (QS) mediated biofilms. Efforts to disrupt biofilms have enabled the identification of bioactive molecules produced by prokaryotes and eukaryotes. These molecules act primarily by quenching the QS system. The phenomenon is also termed as quorum quenching (QQ). In addition, synthetic compounds have also been found to be effective in QQ. This review focuses primarily on natural and synthetic quorum sensing inhibitors (QSIs) with the potential for treating bacterial infections. It has been opined that the most versatile prokaryotes to produce QSI are likely to be those, which are generally regarded as safe. Among the eukaryotes, certain legumes and traditional medicinal plants are likely to act as QSIs. Such findings are likely to lead to efficient treatments with much lower doses of drugs especially antibiotics than required at present. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Droplet formation processes in microfluidic flow focusing devices have been examined previously and some of the key physical mechanisms for droplet formation revealed. However, the underlying physical behavior is still too poorly understood to utilize it for generating droplets of precise size. In this work, we formulate scaling arguments to define dimensionless variables which capture all the parameters that control the droplet breakup process, including the flow rates and the viscosities of the two immiscible fluids, the interfacial tension between the fluids and the numerous dimensions in the flow focusing device. To test these arguments, we perform flow focusing experiments and systematically vary the dimensional parameters. Through these experiments, we confirm the validity of the scaling arguments and find a power law relationship between the normalized droplet size and the capillary number. We demonstrate that droplet formation can be separated into an upstream process for primary droplet formation and a downstream process for thread formation. These results are key to the ability to tune the flow focusing process for specific applications that require monodisperse micron and submicron droplets and particles.},

abstract = {This article describes the process of formation of droplets and bubbles in microfluidic T-junction geometries. At low capillary numbers break-up is not dominated by shear stresses: experimental results support the assertion that the dominant contribution to the dynamics of break-up arises from the pressure drop across the emerging droplet or bubble. This pressure drop results from the high resistance to flow of the continuous (carrier) fluid in the thin films that separate the droplet from the walls of the microchannel when the droplet fills almost the entire cross-section of the channel. A simple scaling relation, based on this assertion, predicts the size of droplets and bubbles produced in the T-junctions over a range of rates of flow of the two immiscible phases, the viscosity of the continuous phase, the interfacial tension, and the geometrical dimensions of the device.},

Persistence was linked to preexisting heterogeneity in bacterial populations because phenotypic switching occurred between normally growing cells and persister cells having reduced growth rates. Quantitative measurements led to a simple mathematical description of the persistence switch. Inherent heterogeneity of bacterial populations may be important in adaptation to fluctuating environments and in the persistence of bacterial infections.},

abstract = {Among the molecular milieu of the cell, the membrane bilayer stands out as a complex and elusive syn-thetic target. We report a microfluidic assembly line that produces uniform cellular compartments from droplet, lipid, and oil/water interface starting materials. Droplets form in a lipid-containing oil flow and travel to a junction where the confluence of oil and extracellular aqueous media esta-blishes a flow-patterned interface that is both stable and re-producible. A triangular post mediates phase transfer bilayer assembly by deflecting droplets from oil, through the interface, and into the extracellular aqueous phase to yield a continuous stream of unilamellar phospholipid vesicles with uniform and tunable size. The size of the droplet precursor dictates vesicle size, encapsulation of small-molecule cargo is highly efficient, and the single bilayer promotes functional insertion of a bacterial transmembrane pore. I n pursuit of a total synthesis of the cell, chemical and enzymatic routes to small-molecule metabolites, oligonucleotides, genes, peptides, and proteins abound, but there are no elegant synthetic strategies for accessing the lipid bilayer envelope. Studies of compartmentalized metabolism and replication 1-3 must instead rely on bulk approaches such as lipid-film hydration 4 and electro-formation 5 to construct the centerpiece membrane bilayer, which is afforded in heterogeneous mixtures of multilamellar structures with inefficient encapsulation and an inscrutable mechanism of assembly.

They are involved in the stabilization of droplet interfaces, in the biocompatibility of the system and in the process of molecular exchange between droplets. The recent progress in the applications of droplet-based microfluidics has been made possible by the development of new molecules and their characterizations. In this review, the role of the surfactant in droplet-based microfluidics is discussed with an emphasis on the new molecules developed specifically to overcome the limitations of 'standard' surfactants. Emulsion properties and interfacial rheology of surfactant-laden layers strongly determine the overall capabilities of the technology. Dynamic properties of droplets, interfaces and emulsions are therefore very important to be characterized, understood and controlled. In this respect, microfluidic systems themselves appear to be very powerful tools for the study of surfactant dynamics at the time- and length-scale relevant to the corresponding microfluidic applications. More generally, microfluidic systems are becoming a new type of experimental platform for the study of the dynamics of interfaces in complex systems.},

This focus was elegantly set in motion a decade ago with the design and construction of a genetic toggle switch and an oscillator, with subsequent highlights that have included circuits capable of pattern generation, noise shaping, edge detection and event counting. Here we describe an engineered gene network with global intercellular coupling that is capable of generating synchronized oscillations in a growing population of cells. Using microfluidic devices tailored for cellular populations at differing length scales, we investigate the collective synchronization properties along with spatiotemporal waves occurring at millimetre scales. We use computational modelling to describe quantitatively the observed dependence of the period and amplitude of the bulk oscillations on the flow rate. The synchronized genetic clock sets the stage for the use of microbes in the creation of a macroscopic biosensor with an oscillatory output. Furthermore, it provides a specific model system for the generation of a mechanistic description of emergent coordinated behaviour at the colony level.},

abstract = {The term 'quorum sensing' (QS) is generally used to describe the phenomenon that bacteria release and perceive signal molecules to coordinate cooperative behaviour in response to their population size. QS-based communication has therefore been considered a social trait. Here we show that QS signals (N-acyl-homoserine lactones, AHLs) are stochastically produced in young biofilms of Pseudomonas putida and act mainly as self-regulatory signals rather than inducing neighbouring cells. We demonstrate that QS induces the expression of putisolvin biosurfactants that are not public goods, thereby triggering asocial motility of induced cells out of microcolonies. Phenotypic heterogeneity is most prominent in the early stages of biofilm development, whereas at later stages behaviour patterns across cells become more synchronized. Our findings broaden our perspective on QS by showing that AHLs can control the expression of asocial (self-directed) traits, and that heterogeneity in QS can serve as a mechanism to drive phenotypic heterogeneity in self-directed behaviour.},

Moreover, microfluidic systems that generate and utilize a stream of sub-nanolitre droplets dispersed within an immiscible continuous phase have the added advantage of allowing ultra-high throughput experimentation and being able to mimic conditions similar to that of a single cell (in terms of volume, pH, and salt concentration) thereby compartmentalizing biological and chemical reactions.

While molecular techniques, such as metagenomic sequencing, can provide some information independent of our ability to culture these organisms, it is essentially impossible to learn new gene and pathway functions from pure sequence data. A true understanding of the physiology of these bacteria and their roles in ecology, host health, and natural product production requires their cultivation in the laboratory. Recent advances in growing these species include coculture with other bacteria, recreating the environment in the laboratory, and combining these approaches with microcultivation technology to increase throughput and access rare species. These studies are unraveling the molecular mechanisms of unculturability and are identifying growth factors that promote the growth of previously unculturable organisms.

Three categories of microfluidic geometries are discussed, including co-flowing streams, cross-flowing streams, and flow focusing devices. In each category we summarize observations that have been reported to date in experiments and numerical simulations. We describe these results in the context of physical mechanisms for droplet breakup, and simple theoretical models that have been proposed. Applications of droplets in microfluidic devices are briefly reviewed.},

abstract = {The emergence of bacterial antibiotic resistance is a growing problem, yet the variables that influence the rate of emergence of resistance are not well understood. In a microfluidic device designed to mimic naturally occurring bacterial niches, resistance of Escherichia coli to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin developed within 10 hours. Resistance emerged with as few as 100 bacteria in the initial inoculation. Whole-genome sequencing of the resistant organisms revealed that four functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms attained fixation. Knowledge about the rapid emergence of antibiotic resistance in the heterogeneous conditions within the mammalian body may be helpful in understanding the emergence of drug resistance during cancer chemotherapy.},

abstract = {High-throughput, cell-based assays require small sample volumes to reduce assay costs and to allow for rapid sample manipulation. However, further miniaturization of conventional microtiter plate technology is problematic due to evaporation and capillary action. To overcome these limitations, we describe droplet-based microfluidic platforms in which cells are grown in aqueous microcompartments separated by an inert perfluorocarbon carrier oil. Synthesis of biocompatible surfactants and identification of gas-permeable storage systems allowed human cells, and even a multicellular organism (C. elegans), to survive and proliferate within the microcompartments for several days. Microcompartments containing single cells could be reinjected into a microfluidic device after incubation to measure expression of a reporter gene. This should open the way for high-throughput, cell-based screening that can use {\textgreater}1000-fold smaller assay volumes and has ∼500× higher throughput than conventional microtiter plate assays. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In recent years, dielectrophoretic force has been used to manipulate colloids, inert particles, and biological microparticles, such as red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, cancer cells, bacteria, yeast, microorganisms, proteins, DNA, etc. This specific electrokinetic technique has been used for trapping, sorting, focusing, filtration, patterning, assembly, and separating biological entities/particles suspended in a buffer medium. Dielectrophoretic forces acting on particles depend on various parameters, for example, charge of the particle, geometry of the device, dielectric constant of the medium and particle, and physiology of the particle. Therefore, to design an effective micro-/nanofluidic separation platform, it is necessary to understand the role of the aforementioned parameters on particle motion. In this paper, we review studies particularly related to dielectrophoretic separation in microfluidic devices. Both experimental and theoretical works by several researchers are highlighted in this article covering AC and DC DEP. In addition, AC/DC DEP, which uses a combination of low frequency AC and DC voltage to manipulate bioparticles, has been discussed briefly. Contactless DEP, a variation of DC DEP in which electrodes do not come in contact with particles, has also been reviewed. Moreover, dielectrophoretic force-based field flow fractionations are featured to demonstrate the bioparticle separation in microfluidic device. In numerical front, a comprehensive review is provided starting from the most simplified effective moment Stokes-drag (EMSD) method to the most advanced interface resolved method. Unlike EMSD method, recently developed advanced numerical methods consider the size and shape of the particle in the electric and flow field calculations, and these methods provide much more accurate results than the EMSD method for microparticles.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Precise control of droplet volumes and reliable manipulation of individual droplets such as coalescence, mixing of their contents, and sorting in combination with fast analysis tools allow us to perform chemical reactions inside the droplets under defined conditions. In this paper, we will review available drop generation and manipulation techniques. The main focus of this review is not to be comprehensive and explain all techniques in great detail but to identify and shed light on similarities and underlying physical principles. Since geometry and wetting properties of the microfluidic channels are crucial factors for droplet generation, we also briefly describe typical device fabrication methods in droplet based microfluidics. Examples of applications and reaction schemes which rely on the discussed manipulation techniques are also presented, such as the fabrication of special materials and biophysical experiments.

The protocol involves seeding and growing bacteria on small agarose pads and imaging the resulting microcolonies. Images are then reviewed and analyzed using our laboratory's custom MATLAB analysis code, which segments and tracks cells in a frame-to-frame method. This process yields quantitative expression data on cell lineages, which can illustrate dynamic expression profiles and facilitate mathematical models of gene circuits.

abstract = {Rapid prototyping of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is frequently used to build microfluidic devices. PDMS is inherently hydrophobic; however, the surface can be temporarily rendered hydrophilic by exposing the surface to oxygen plasma. Hydrophilic microchannels are sometimes advantageous over hydrophobic microchannels due to increased cell adhesion or increase in electro osmotic flow (EOF) leading to ease of liquid filling in microchannels. However, the hydrophilic surface is unstable and that low molecular weight (LMW) chains diffuse from the bulk of the PDMS and cover up the thermodynamically unstable surface. This is one reason for the hydrophilic unstability of PDMS. Present study shows that not only chemistry of the creation of silanol groups on the surface, but also morphology of the film surface nanostructuring of PDMS plays an important role in hydrophilization of PDMS. Present paper tries to understand the mechanism of hydrophobic recovery taking into consideration physical and chemical parameters using SEM characterization.},

These materials were processed by spin coating and subjected to common micro-fabrication, micro-machining, and biomedical processes: chemical immersion, oxygen plasma treatment, sterilization, and exposure to tissue culture media. The PDMS formulations were analyzed by gravimetry, goniometry, tensile testing, nano-indentation, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Spin coating of PDMS was formulation dependent with film thickness ranging from 308 microm on PDMS1 to 171 microm on PDMS5 at 200 revolutions per minute (rpm). Ultimate tensile stress (UTS) increased from 3.9 MPa (PDMS1) to 10.8 MPa (PDMS3), and then decreased down to 4.0 MPa (PDMS5). Autoclave sterilization (AS) increased the storage modulus (sigma) and UTS in all formulations, with the highest increase in UTS exhibited by PDMS5 (218{\%}). PDMS surface hydrophilicity and micro-textures were generally unaffected when exposed to the different chemicals, except for micro-texture changes after immersion in potassium hydroxide and buffered hydrofluoric, nitric, sulfuric, and hydrofluoric acids; and minimal changes in contact angle after immersion in hexane, hydrochloric acid, photoresist developer, and toluene. Oxygen plasma treatment decreased the contact angle of PDMS2 from 109 degrees to 60 degrees.

The results show that at a plasma power of 70 W, an extended treatment of over 5 min would allow the PDMS surface to remain hydrophilic for more than 6 h. Storing the treated PDMS devices in de-ionized water would allow them to maintain their hydrophilicity for weeks. Atomic force microscopy analysis shows that a longer oxygen plasma time produces a smoother surface.},

abstract = {Plasma treatment of silicone surfaces is a useful way of increasing wettability to improve adhesion and a first step in producing various organosilicon thin-film composites. Despite numerous earlier studies, there is no consensus on the effect of plasma treatment nor on the mechanism of the subsequent hydrophobic recovery.

@article{Hillborg2000,
abstract = {Spin-coated specimens of crosslinked polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) exposed to radio-frequency (RF) and microwave (MW) oxygen plasma were studied by specular neutron reflectometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Wilhelmy balance, contact angle measurements, scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Neutron reflectometry and XPS showed that the oxygen plasma led to the formation of a smooth ({\textless}10nm), oxidised surface layer with a thickness of 130–160nm. The oxidised layer contained a mixture of the original polymer and silicon bonded to three or four oxygen atoms (SiOx). The oxidised layer was thinner after longer plasma exposure, indicating a decrease in specific volume due to a conversion of the polymer structure to an inorganic SiOx-rich structure. The formation of the SiOx-containing layer with low segmental mobility was further confirmed by the small hysteresis in the Wilhelmy balance measurements. The similarity in the hydrophobicity recovery kinetics of specimens aged in dry air, dry argon and vacuum and XPS data showed that the hydrophobicity recovery is not due to contamination through adsorption from the atmosphere but due to migration of low molar mass PDMS species to the surface. Scanning electron microscopy also showed the presence of surface cracks in heavily oxidised specimens.},

abstract = {A microfluidic device capable of storing picoliter droplets containing single bacteria at constant volumes has been fabricated in PDMS. Once captured in droplets that remain static in the device, bacteria express both a red fluorescent protein (mRFP1) and the enzyme, alkaline phosphatase (AP), from a biscistronic construct. By measuring the fluorescence intensity of both the mRFP1 inside the cells and a fluorescent product formed as a result of the enzymatic activity outside the cells, gene expression and enzymatic activity can be simultaneously and continuously monitored. By collecting data from many individual cells, the distribution of activities in a cell is quantified and the difference in activity between two AP mutants is measured.},

Combining information from a sequence of video images into single-particle trajectories makes possible measurements of quantities of fundamental and practical interest such as diffusion coefficients and pair-wise interaction potentials. The measurements we describe in detail combine the outstanding resolution of digital imaging with video-synchronized optical trapping to obtain highly accurate and reproducible results very rapidly.},

abstract = {Clonal populations of cells exhibit substantial phenotypic variation. Such heterogeneity can be essential for many biological processes and is conjectured to arise from stochasticity, or noise, in gene expression. We constructed strains of Escherichia coli that enable detection of noise and discrimination between the two mechanisms by which it is generated. Both stochasticity inherent in the biochemical process of gene expression (intrinsic noise) and fluctuations in other cellular components (extrinsic noise) contribute substantially to overall variation. Transcription rate, regulatory dynamics, and genetic factors control the amplitude of noise. These results establish a quantitative foundation for modeling noise in genetic networks and reveal how low intracellular copy numbers of molecules can fundamentally limit the precision of gene regulation.},
